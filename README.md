[Classification with an Academic Success Dataset]

## Classification with an Academic Success Dataset
- Goal:  The goal of this competition is to predict academic risk of students in higher education.
- Descrption: The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. 
- Evaluation: Submissions are evaluated using the accuracy score.

## Exploring Mental Health Data
- Goal: The goal of this competition is to predict the depression. 
- Descrption: The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
- Evaluation: Submissions are evaluated using Accuracy Score. 
- Focus: This is not a particularly difficult dataset to model. It may be interesting to focus on different ways to visualize the dataset.
- My approach:
